It’s a temperature roulette in here.\nI promise that the aesthetics of this site are in progress. But it’s what’s on the inside that counts, right?\nCheck out the blog here"

I have a particularly strong (negative) feeling towards SUVs in cities. In former lives I played classical flute, got my master’s in physics and worked as an energy consultant in a Big Company. In current and parallel lives I’m a (very) amateur forager, nature enthusiast, vegan, and climate activist. Vom."
