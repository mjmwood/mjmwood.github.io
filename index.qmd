Welcome to my informal and poorly maintained blog where I, Maria, occasionally write about things I care about including cars and transport, climate, politics, life, etc. Sometimes the takes are hot, sometimes they are tepid. It's a temperature roulette in here.

I promise that the aesthetics of this site are in progress. But it's what's on the inside that counts, right?
